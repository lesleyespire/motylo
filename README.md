# Motylo
This is my biggest project yet, the chat website motylo! 

It's taking a lot of time, but slowly but surely it's starting to take form. If you'd like to access it, you can see the development site here; developingmotylo.infinityfreeapp.com

The full complete site is on a seperate address, but since it may be vulnerable to attack, you'll have to personally request access. 

It's starting to work very well and we have voice chat, profile pictures, basic chat functions, basic moderation, authentication with hashes, typing indicators, profiles and private rooms!! There's still a lot more to come!
